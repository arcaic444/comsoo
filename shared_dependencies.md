As we are only generating a README.md file, there are no shared dependencies in terms of exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names. The README.md file is a standalone document that provides instructions on how to set up and use the application. It does not interact with any other files or elements, and therefore does not share any dependencies.
